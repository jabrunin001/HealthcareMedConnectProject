MedConnect: Healthcare Data Integration Platform
Overview
MedConnect is a serverless, cloud-native platform that bridges healthcare systems with advanced analytics and AI capabilities. It facilitates secure, scalable processing of healthcare data through FHIR standards, offering real-time insights and predictions through a robust REST API.
Key Features

FHIR-Compliant API: Seamless integration with electronic health record systems
Event-Driven Architecture: Real-time processing using AWS Kinesis streams
Serverless Design: Highly scalable Lambda functions for core services
ML-Powered Analytics: Predictive risk assessment using healthcare data
Kubernetes Deployment: Containerized ML inference services on EKS
Data Pipeline Automation: Workflow orchestration through Apache Airflow

Architecture
MedConnect employs a multi-tier architecture leveraging AWS cloud services:

API Layer: AWS API Gateway + Lambda handlers with Django REST Framework
Processing Layer: Event-driven data processing using Kinesis streams
Storage Layer: DynamoDB for operational data, S3 for ML artifacts
ML Layer: Python-based ML models deployed on Kubernetes (EKS)

Technologies

Core: Python 3.9, Django REST Framework
Cloud: AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Kinesis, S3, EKS)
Data: Pandas, dbt, AWS Glue
ML: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Orchestration: Apache Airflow, AWS EventBridge
Infrastructure: AWS CDK (Infrastructure as Code)

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.9+
AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
Docker and kubectl for local development
Access to a FHIR-compliant test server

Environment Setup
bashCopy# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medconnect.git
cd medconnect

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
Local Development
bashCopy# Run tests
pytest

# Start local API (uses AWS SAM)
sam local start-api
Deployment
bashCopy# Deploy infrastructure
cd infrastructure
cdk deploy

# Deploy Airflow DAGs
cd ../airflow
./deploy_dags.sh
Project Structure
The repository follows a domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns:

api/: Lambda function handlers for the REST API
core/: Business logic and domain services
data/: Data access layer and repositories
infrastructure/: AWS CDK deployment code
airflow/: Airflow DAGs for data pipelines
kubernetes/: Kubernetes manifests for EKS deployment

Development Workflow

Create a feature branch from main
Implement changes with tests
Run local validation: ./scripts/validate.sh
Create a pull request for review
Merge to main to trigger CI/CD pipeline

Testing
MedConnect includes comprehensive test coverage:
bashCopy# Run unit tests
pytest tests/unit

# Run integration tests (requires AWS credentials)
pytest tests/integration

# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=medconnect
Security Considerations

All PHI/PII data is encrypted at rest and in transit
Authentication via JWT tokens with fine-grained authorization
Regular security scanning through CI/CD pipeline
Compliance with healthcare data regulations

# MedConnect: Healthcare Data Integration Platform

## Overview

MedConnect is a serverless, cloud-native platform that bridges healthcare systems with advanced analytics and AI capabilities. It facilitates secure, scalable processing of healthcare data through FHIR standards, offering real-time insights and predictions through a robust REST API.

## Key Features

- **FHIR-Compliant API**: Seamless integration with electronic health record systems
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Real-time processing using AWS Kinesis streams
- **Serverless Design**: Highly scalable Lambda functions for core services
- **ML-Powered Analytics**: Predictive risk assessment using healthcare data
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Containerized ML inference services on EKS
- **Data Pipeline Automation**: Workflow orchestration through Apache Airflow

## Architecture

MedConnect employs a multi-tier architecture leveraging AWS cloud services:

- **API Layer**: AWS API Gateway + Lambda handlers with Django REST Framework
- **Processing Layer**: Event-driven data processing using Kinesis streams
- **Storage Layer**: DynamoDB for operational data, S3 for ML artifacts
- **ML Layer**: Python-based ML models deployed on Kubernetes (EKS)

## Technologies

- **Core**: Python 3.9, Django REST Framework
- **Cloud**: AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Kinesis, S3, EKS)
- **Data**: Pandas, dbt, AWS Glue
- **ML**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow, AWS EventBridge
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK (Infrastructure as Code)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Docker and kubectl for local development
- Access to a FHIR-compliant test server

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone
cd medconnect

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Start local API (uses AWS SAM)
sam local start-api
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy infrastructure
cd infrastructure
cdk deploy

# Deploy Airflow DAGs
cd ../airflow
./deploy_dags.sh
```

## Project Structure

The repository follows a domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns:

- `api/`: Lambda function handlers for the REST API
- `core/`: Business logic and domain services
- `data/`: Data access layer and repositories
- `infrastructure/`: AWS CDK deployment code
- `airflow/`: Airflow DAGs for data pipelines
- `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes manifests for EKS deployment

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run local validation: `./scripts/validate.sh`
4. Create a pull request for review
5. Merge to `main` to trigger CI/CD pipeline

## Testing

MedConnect includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run unit tests
pytest tests/unit

# Run integration tests (requires AWS credentials)
pytest tests/integration

# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=medconnect
```

## Security Considerations

- All PHI/PII data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Authentication via JWT tokens with fine-grained authorization
- Regular security scanning through CI/CD pipeline
- Compliance with healthcare data regulations

## Contributing

1. Set up your development environment
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit a pull request with comprehensive tests

## Why This Architecture?

This architecture demonstrates several key strengths ideal for the position requirements:

1. **Why serverless?** Lambda functions provide auto-scaling, pay-per-use pricing, and simplified deployment for our Python backend.

2. **Why event-driven?** Healthcare systems generate data asynchronously - Kinesis streams decouple data production from consumption, enabling real-time analytics.

3. **Why Kubernetes for ML?** ML models require GPU resources and complex dependencies that benefit from containerized deployment, while EKS provides the orchestration layer.

4. **Why FHIR?** Healthcare interoperability demands standardized data exchange - FHIR has emerged as the industry standard for modern health data APIs.

5. **Why DynamoDB?** Schemaless NoSQL provides flexibility for varied healthcare data models while maintaining high performance at scale.

The architecture balances modern cloud-native patterns with healthcare domain requirements, showcasing both technical sophistication and industry awareness.
